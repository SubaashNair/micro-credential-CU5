## 📚 Case Study Parts

### **Part 1: The Reality - "Our data is a mess"**
**Notebook**: `part1_the_reality.ipynb`

**What You'll See**:
- Raw, messy e-commerce sales data
- Missing values in critical fields
- Inconsistent formatting and data types
- Duplicate records
- No standardized naming conventions

**The Problem**: This is what real-world data looks like. Without proper preparation, any AI model built on this will fail.

---

### **Part 2: Getting "Ready" (Step 1) - Data Cleaning & Preparation**
**Notebook**: `part2_data_cleaning.ipynb`  
**Course Modules**: Module 1-2

**What You'll Learn**:
- ✅ Handle missing values strategically
- ✅ Standardize data types and formats
- ✅ Remove duplicates and outliers
- ✅ Create analysis-ready datasets with Pandas & NumPy

**Outcome**: Transform chaos into clean, structured data ready for analysis.

---

### **Part 3: Understanding Your Data - Exploration & Statistics**
**Notebook**: `part3_exploration_stats.ipynb`  
**Course Modules**: Module 2-3

**What You'll Learn**:
- 📊 Visualize sales trends and patterns
- 📈 Identify seasonality and correlations
- 🔍 Statistical validation and hypothesis testing
- 💡 Feature engineering for better predictions

**Outcome**: Deep understanding of what drives sales and which variables matter.

---

### **Part 4: Building the Right Model - Machine Learning**
**Notebook**: `part4_ml_models.ipynb`  
**Course Module**: Module 4

**What You'll Learn**:
- 🎯 Linear Regression for baseline predictions
- 🌳 Random Forest for capturing non-linear patterns
- 📊 Model evaluation and comparison
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning

**Outcome**: Production-ready forecasting models with measurable accuracy.

---

### **Part 5: Advanced AI - Deep Learning**
**Notebook**: `part5_deep_learning.ipynb`  
**Course Module**: Module 5

**What You'll Learn**:
- 🧠 Build neural networks with Keras/TensorFlow
- 📉 LSTM networks for time series forecasting
- 🔄 Sequence prediction for multi-step forecasting
- 🚀 Compare deep learning vs traditional ML

**Outcome**: State-of-the-art forecasting using deep learning techniques.
